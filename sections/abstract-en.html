<p>The <strong>Managing Bridge Data Ontology (MBDO)</strong> provides a semantic framework for representing structural, spatial, material, and inspection-related information about bridges.</p>
<p>It integrates multiple aspects of bridge knowledge including geometry, construction phases, material specifications, and crack or damage assessment.</p>
<p>This ontology is designed for researchers and engineers seeking to formalize, analyze, and share bridge data across systems and applications.</p>
