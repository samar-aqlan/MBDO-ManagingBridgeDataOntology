<p>The Managing Bridge Data Ontology (MBDO) is designed to represent, structure, and manage 
data related to bridges, including their components, materials, spatial characteristics, 
and construction attributes. It provides a semantic foundation for integrating and querying 
bridge-related information in a consistent and machine-readable way.</p>
<h3 class="list" style="border-bottom:none;">Purpose</h3>
<p>This ontology aims to support infrastructure knowledge management by enabling data interoperability and integration across various systems that handle bridge design, inspection, and lifecycle data.</p>
<h3 class="list" style="border-bottom:none;">Scope</h3>
<p>MBDO includes concepts for bridge structures, materials, spatial locations, construction details, and semantic relationships between bridge components and external datasets (e.g., geographic data, structural metadata).</p>
<h3 class="list" style="border-bottom:none;">Intended Audience</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Researchers in civil engineering and semantic web</li>
  <li>Infrastructure asset managers</li>
  <li>Bridge inspectors and analysts</li>
  <li>Developers of digital twin and BIM systems</li>
</ul>
